# C++ Library
This is a Repository where I manage C++ implementation of features from other programming language.
Creating and Implementing different features is a great way to hone and improve your coding practice, logic and understanding. It is a great way to enhance creativity as it provide a way to creating new function rather than just solving existing problem.

# Javasript

## Date and Time
In JavaScript, date and time are represented by the Date object. The Date object provides the date and time information and also provides various methods.
A JavaScript date defines the EcmaScript epoch that represents milliseconds since 1 January 1970 UTC. This date and time is the same as the UNIX epoch (predominant base value for computer-recorded date and time values).

Example in Javasript :

Our implementation in C++ :

## Method Chaining
Method Chaining is a programming strategy that simplifies and embellishes your code. It is a mechanism of calling a method on another method of the same object.
In Method Chaining, we call separate methods of a single object like a chain without assigning the same object multiple times by assignment operators.

Example in Javasript :

Our implementation in C++ :

# How to Use
To use the code snippets. one simply need to :
	Download the Header File for the intended feature.
	Include the file in C++ program using '#include "<file_name>"' command.
